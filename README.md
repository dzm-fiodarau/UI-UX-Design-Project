## Understanding the Problem
The measures and restrictions that Quebec had to put in place in the last years to deal with the global Covid-19 pandemic severely impacted its economy. One sector in particular that has suffered great losses is the food services.

Local restaurants had to quickly adapt to constant shutdowns and re-openings if they wanted to survive through this crisis. This is why now more than ever it is important to help these businesses to recover. To increase their revenue and lower the consequences of high inflation they need to maximize their accessibility and their visibility among the population. Even if some apps already exist which allow people to discover restaurants around them, these apps have multiple shortcomings. Most of these shortfalls are due to the fact that such applications are owned by big corporations whose primary goal is to make profit for themselves. This negatively impacts the UI of the application and limits the features offered.

## Application Concept
To help local restaurants recover from the difficulties of the past few years, we decided to design a mobile application. Its goal is to let people of Quebec discover restaurants around them in a similar way to Uber Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes. However, our application focuses only on local restaurants which means franchised restaurants are excluded from it.

The way that we decided to support local businesses through our application is by maximizing the clientele for them. This means that during the whole design process the client was considered as the main target audience. Designing with this target audience in mind allows us to have a final product that is practical, simple, and appealing to use. If those are all qualities our product has, there should be more people ordering from and reserving tables at local restaurants which should help them get through the rough patch.

        <h1 class="title">Understanding the Problem</h1>
        <p class="text">The measures and restrictions that Quebec had to put in place in the last years to deal with the
            global Covid-19 pandemic severely impacted its economy. One sector in particular that has suffered great
            losses is the food services.
            <br />
            <br />
            Local restaurants had to quickly adapt to constant shutdowns and re-openings if they wanted to survive
            through this crisis. This is why now more than ever it is important to help these businesses to recover. To
            increase their revenue and lower the consequences of high inflation they need to maximize their
            accessibility and their visibility among the population. Even if some apps already exist which allow people
            to discover restaurants around them, these apps have multiple shortcomings. Most of these shortfalls are due
            to the fact that such applications are owned by big corporations whose primary goal is to make profit for
            themselves. This negatively impacts the UI of the application and limits the features offered.
        </p>

        <br id="app-context" />
        <h1 class="title">Application Concept</h1>
        <p class="text">
            To help local restaurants recover from the difficulties of the past few years, we decided to design a mobile
            application. Its goal is to let people of Quebec discover restaurants around them in a similar way to Uber
            Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes. However, our application focuses only on local restaurants which means
            franchised restaurants are excluded from it.
            <br />
            <br />
            The way that we decided to support local businesses through our application is by maximizing the clientele
            for them. This means that during the whole design process the client was considered as the main target
            audience. Designing with this target audience in mind allows us to have a final product that is practical,
            simple, and appealing to use. If those are all qualities our product has, there should be more people
            ordering from and reserving tables at local restaurants which should help them get through the rough patch.

        <h3 class="subtitle">Market Analysis</h3>
        <p class="text">
            There already exist multiple applications that allow customers to explore restaurants near them and directly
            choose between the delivery or pickup options. The most popular ones share a lot of similarities in their
            design and in the features that they offer. This also means that they share some shortcomings which mostly
            come from the fact that their primary focus is to generate profit for themselves. The following table
            captures the analysis of the three biggest food apps used in Quebec: Uber Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes.

        <h3 class="subtitle">User Personas</h3>
        <p class="text">
            As was mentioned previously, our target audience is the clientele because we want to increase
            their numbers to help the local restaurants. This is why designing for the user experience of people looking
            to order some food or reserve a table at a restaurant is our main goal. To get a better understanding of
            those who will use our application from the point of view of the buyer, we created three user personas.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Roboto-Bold">Leila</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Leila is living through a very stressful period of her life. She has a lot on her plate and this is why
            sometimes, she lacks motivation to get things done. Exploring local restaurants new to her is something that
            she enjoys, so ordering food through our application would be considered as a treat to her. This is a good
            way she found to motivate herself to work hard on her classes. It is important to keep in mind that health
            is important to her, so she is always looking for healthy food options in the menus. It is also relevant to
            think about the fact that she is still a student which means she probably does not have a lot of money. So,
            the Promotions tab of EatAround is something she finds very useful.

            Liam is a young professional who is very driven by his job. Success is his most important goal, but because
            of that he often lacks time for things other than his work. He represents the target audience that does not
            have time to cook but has more than enough resources to order food daily. Speed and efficiency are the
            things Liam is looking for when he orders food, so the filtering and sorting features of EatAround is
            something he is expected to use very much.

            Robert is playful and spontaneous, but the thing he values most in his life is his family. He tries to
            constantly put effort into his marriage because he does not want it to become boring and monotonous. To keep
            some spark between him and his wife, he often organizes surprise dates for her. The EatAround application is
            interesting to him because it gives him the opportunity to see cute, local restaurants around him and
            reserve a table right away at the spot he chooses. His curious nature and his goal to keep his wife happy is
            what drives him to use EatAround.

            User journey , also known as customer journey map, is a diagram that visually illustrates the user flow
            through your site, starting with initial contact or discovery, and continuing through the process of
            engagement into long-term loyalty and advocacy. It is a path a user may take to reach their goal when using
            your website. Constructing them, helped us to deliver a better user experience according to their

            healthy. In her experience with our app, choosing a restaurant and payment method makes her lost and unsure.
            She sees many restaurant options and is not sure whether our deals are actually good deals or not. In order
            for the user to have a better experience we have to make sure our deals are actually good and price worthy.
            In many competitor applications, the deals are not that advantageous. In Leila's case, we have to make sure
            our app offers multiple payment methods, so that she can pay with the method she prefers.

            Liam is a hardworking businessman who works from home. Most of the time he does not have enough time to
            cook. He heard about our application and decided to give it a try. He mostly felt depressed and annoyed
            while choosing a restaurant, sorting by the delivery time and order confirmations. He has a specific time to
            take his lunch, and what is important for him is to order his food as quickly as possible and receive it on
            time. As a developer, we have to make sure that users like Liam who are in a hurry, won’t feel frustrated
            and can order quickly. Liam was annoyed by the fact that in our app the user should pass through multiple
            confirmation pages before the order is finalized, but those are important steps in the application to make
            sure the user will not order by mistake or to the wrong address.

        <h3 style="font-family:Roboto-Bold">Robert</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Robert is planning to have a birthday party for the weekend. In the previous weeks, he asked his friends if
            everyone was available to attend. He downloaded our app to use the “Table reservation” feature. Everything
            went as planned until he tried to book a table in a specific restaurant, at some point he got mad because
            the date he selected was not available and he was worried that he may not be able to find a table for the
            weekend. By using the available option, he managed to find a table for Sunday instead of Saturday. In
            Robert's case, we found that we have to make sure once a date is not available, make it blocked out so the
            user will not need to come back again. We worked on this issue in our later design steps. We decided that
            instead of two separate pages one of which tells the user that the date he has chosen is unavailable, there
            will be only one page which will be dynamic.

            we needed to start thinking of how our application will work. We decided to use a user flowchart to get
            an
            idea of what the flow of EatAround will be. This is why we included all actions that can be performed by
            the
            user at different stages of the application use. This flowchart gives an initial structure to our
            application and even helps figure out some conditions that we will have to verify for some of its pages.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            With our sketches we tried to make the application as consistent and as intuitive as we could. All
            buttons
            that allow to progress in a sequence are placed at the bottom with an arrow pointing to the right. We
            still
            kept in mind to allow the user to go back in his steps if he ever wants to change something or make sure
            he
            entered the right thing. The button for this 'Go Back' feature is placed in all of the sketches at the
            top
            with an arrow pointing to the left.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also tried to use many icons in our sketches in addition to the written text that helps the user
            understand what each button does. Having the text and the icon decreases the chances that the user's
            expectations of a button's functionality are not in accordance with what the button actually does.
            <br />
            <br />
            These skectches represent the initial design we had for our application, but in the following steps
            there
            were some improvements made.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Wireframes</h3>
        <p class="text">
            By constructing wireframes using the sketches previously drawn we got a better idea of the structure of
            different pages. We also were able to include some improvements in the design which result in better
            user
            interface and a better user experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the starting page we added the entered phone number needed to register to the application because
            the
            Get Started button should be absent if no number was entered. This is done to avoid user's confusion, so
            that he does not try to click on a button that won't work for him at that stage. The Explore tab with
            its
            two functionalities (filter and sort) stayed with the same structure as in the sketches, but now it
            looks
            much cleaner.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">

            <img src="media/Wireframes/4.png" width="24%" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p class="text">
            The Promotions tab in the wireframes did not change from its original sketch either.
            <br />
            <br />
            My Account tab, on the
            other hand, had multiple improvements added. First, toggle buttons were added to the Orders and
            Reservations
            sections. This allows the user to see not only his current orders and future reservations, but also to
            navigate through his history. Users expect this traceability because most of the applications on the
            market
            offer this functionality. Second, the Remove button in the Payment Methods section was placed on each
            specific card to avoid unnecessary steps like selection of cards that you want to remove. The Add button
            stayed at the same position, however.
            <br />
            <br />
            To the Add Payment Method page the Postal Code field was added as it is something relevant to adding a
            payment method in some cases.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the Track Your Order page the thing that was improved is the format of status visibility. We decided
            to
            include all stages of the order delivery to give a better understanding to the user as to where he
            stands.

        <p class="text">
            For the Table Reservation pages, one of the sketches was excluded from the wireframes because it added
            some
            unnecessary steps to the process which could of damaged the user experience. Instead, it was decided
            that
            the page where the user selects the date and time of the reservation will be dynamic. It would allow the
            user to choose only dates and times that are available with appropriate indications.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Restaurant's Details page had a small modification as to how the schedule is presented. This is due
            to
            one of the points we concluded with the survey we conducted as the restaurant's schedule one of the
            things
            people had the most difficulty finding on similar apps. We decided to make the opening hours of the
            restaurants obvious for the user. The Reserve Table button presentation also changed. We decided that
            because the reservation feature is one of the main functionalities that our application has to offer
            that
            others don't have, we should emphasise it.

            For the Order Delivery feature pages of EatAround, the wireframes were pretty consistent with the
            sketches
            drawn previsouly.

        <h3 class="subtitle">Color Palette</h3>
        <p class="text">
            The color palette we chose for our application consists of only three colors: black, white, and a
            specific
            shade of blue.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="media/Colors/Black.png" width="32%" />
            <img src="media/Colors/White.png" width="32%" />
            <img src="media/Colors/Blue.png" width="32%" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p class="text">
            The reason behind this simple color palette comes from one of the strengths we observed in applications
            similar to our own. The colors used by big food delivery applications are mostly limited to three or
            four
            colors. This avoids overwhelming the user and keeps all of the user's attention on beautiful pictures
            restaurants choose to represent themselves. As our main goal is to encourage people to discover local
            restaurants around them, we want to keep their focus on what these restaurants have to offer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another reason behind this color palette is to give a professional look to the application. Local
            restaurants are rarely perceived as professional by the average user, so we wanted to shift this
            negative
            perception. Even if most of the local restaurants are relatively small and do not have as much resources
            as
            some big chain restaurants, the quality of their food and the experience they can make you live are even
            better.
            <br />
            <br />
            The choice of the blue shade to accompany the black and white colors was done because of how it is
            perceived. Blue is a color that represents strength, relaxation, and reliability. We wanted to make the user
            feel as he does not have to stress about anything when using our application. Of course, we also wanted the
            user to trust our application, so this notion of reliability transmitted through the blue color was perfect
            for that.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Typography</h3>
        <p class="text">
            To be consistent with the professional look we wanted to give to EatAround, we chose ‘Roboto’ as the
            main
            font. It is easy to read which is important so that the user does not get confused and it has a strength
            to
            it which gives the user a feeling of reliability.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="media/Roboto.png" width="50%" />
        </div>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Icons</h3>
        <p class="text">
            In EatAround, we decided to use many icons in addition to the visual text a person can read to make the
            interface more intuitive and appealing. Most of the icons were chosen to have soft/rounded edges to make
            it
            consistent with the rest of the app. In other words, most of the icons are used as buttons and buttons
            that
            are not icons all have rounded edges in the application. This was a choice made to avoid the application
            being perceived as too aggressive.

            For our high-fidelity prototype, we created one using Figma. You can have an insight into our final

        <h3 class="subtitle">Final Improvements</h3>
        <p class="text">
            As you noticed while going through our high-fidelity prototype, in addition to the visual details of the
            application there were some other improvements that were added since the wireframes phase.
            <br />
            <br />
            First, in the My Account tab, there were some additional buttons that were added like Track for Orders
            and
            See Details and Cancel for Reservations. This offers some additional features that were missing in the
            previous stages of the design process, but we judged essential to offer the right functionalities and to
            make the design more intuitive.
            <br />
            <br />
            Second, some of the wording for the buttons allowing the user to go from one stage to the next in the
            delivery ordering or table reserving processes was changed. This was done to make the application more
            consistent.
            <br />
            <br />
            Third, on the Track Your Order page, for the status bar of the delivery, we decided to include both
            icons
            and text for the different stages. This makes it much clearer to the user what is happening with his
            order,
            and makes it consistent with other buttons in the application like the main tab menu for example.
            <br />
            <br />
            The design choice for the maps was decided to focus mainly on the two significant locations (restaurant
            and
            delivery address) and the route between them. That is why the map around the route is in the black
            shades
            and the route is put in a shade of blue. This was not implemented on the Delivery Address page because
            at
            that stage our main focus is for the user to enter the right address, so it is important he can
            recognize
            the streets around his house.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Unimplemented Functionalities</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Some functionalities were not shown in the high-fidelity prototype because some were too complicated to
            implement in a prototype like this one and some other because we did not judge them as important to show
            as
            those that were included. The Filter and Sort buttons in the Promotions tab are supposed to function in
            the
            same way as they work in the Explore tab. Clicking on a specific promotion, on the other hand, is
            supposed
            to get the user to the details page of the specific restaurant with the promotion applied, but this is
            something that was a little more difficult to show in the prototype. The Cancel button and the Remove
            button
            in the My Account tab are other features that were not included in the prototype, but their
            functionality is
            self-explanatory. On the Restaurant's Details page the Call Resturant button in the form of the
            cellphone
            icon was not implemented either, but it is supposed to redirect the user into their phone app with the
            resturant's phone number automatically filled in.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="text">
            This project was really interesting to work on because it allowed us to put in practice some concepts
            that
            we learnt in class only in theory. Applying the user personas and their journeys, constructing the
            flowchart
            and designing the prototype through the sketches and wireframe stages for an application feels
            completely
            different than when you only apply it to a small example in class. Designing the UI and for the UX with
            the
            user in mind is something that is much more difficult to do than what it seems and we are happy to have
            gotten this opportunity to learn.

        <h1 class="title">Understanding the Problem</h1>
        <p class="text">The measures and restrictions that Quebec had to put in place in the last years to deal with the
            global Covid-19 pandemic severely impacted its economy. One sector in particular that has suffered great
            losses is the food services.
            <br />
            <br />
            Local restaurants had to quickly adapt to constant shutdowns and re-openings if they wanted to survive
            through this crisis. This is why now more than ever it is important to help these businesses to recover. To
            increase their revenue and lower the consequences of high inflation they need to maximize their
            accessibility and their visibility among the population. Even if some apps already exist which allow people
            to discover restaurants around them, these apps have multiple shortcomings. Most of these shortfalls are due
            to the fact that such applications are owned by big corporations whose primary goal is to make profit for
            themselves. This negatively impacts the UI of the application and limits the features offered.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title">Application Concept</h1>
        <p class="text">
            To help local restaurants recover from the difficulties of the past few years, we decided to design a mobile
            application. Its goal is to let people of Quebec discover restaurants around them in a similar way to Uber
            Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes. However, our application focuses only on local restaurants which means
            franchised restaurants are excluded from it.
            <br />
            <br />
            The way that we decided to support local businesses through our application is by maximizing the clientele
            for them. This means that during the whole design process the client was considered as the main target
            audience. Designing with this target audience in mind allows us to have a final product that is practical,
            simple, and appealing to use. If those are all qualities our product has, there should be more people
            ordering from and reserving tables at local restaurants which should help them get through the rough patch.

        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Market Analysis</h3>
        <p class="text">
            There already exist multiple applications that allow customers to explore restaurants near them and directly
            choose between the delivery or pickup options. The most popular ones share a lot of similarities in their
            design and in the features that they offer. This also means that they share some shortcomings which mostly
            come from the fact that their primary focus is to generate profit for themselves. The following table
            captures the analysis of the three biggest food apps used in Quebec: Uber Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes.

        <p class="text">
            Leila is living through a very stressful period of her life. She has a lot on her plate and this is why
            sometimes, she lacks motivation to get things done. Exploring local restaurants new to her is something that
            she enjoys, so ordering food through our application would be considered as a treat to her. This is a good
            way she found to motivate herself to work hard on her classes. It is important to keep in mind that health
            is important to her, so she is always looking for healthy food options in the menus. It is also relevant to
            think about the fact that she is still a student which means she probably does not have a lot of money. So,
            the Promotions tab of EatAround is something she finds very useful.

        <h3 style="font-family:Roboto-Bold">Liam</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Liam is a young professional who is very driven by his job. Success is his most important goal, but because
            of that he often lacks time for things other than his work. He represents the target audience that does not
            have time to cook but has more than enough resources to order food daily. Speed and efficiency are the
            things Liam is looking for when he orders food, so the filtering and sorting features of EatAround is
            something he is expected to use very much.

        <p class="text">
            Robert is playful and spontaneous, but the thing he values most in his life is his family. He tries to
            constantly put effort into his marriage because he does not want it to become boring and monotonous. To keep
            some spark between him and his wife, he often organizes surprise dates for her. The EatAround application is
            interesting to him because it gives him the opportunity to see cute, local restaurants around him and
            reserve a table right away at the spot he chooses. His curious nature and his goal to keep his wife happy is
            what drives him to use EatAround.
